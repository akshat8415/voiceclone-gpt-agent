🎙️ Mic Input → 🔊 Voice Recording
→ 🧠 Encoder (Embedding)
→ 💬 GPT Response
→ 🎵 Synthesizer (Spectrogram)
→ 🔈 Vocoder (Waveform Generation)
→ 🔁 Playback with Cloned Voice
🧪 3. Modules & Algorithms Used:
✅ a. Voice Preprocessing
Function: Clean raw input (.wav) using encoder.preprocess_wav()

Removes background noise, normalizes voice.

✅ b. Voice Embedding
Used Real-Time Voice Cloning encoder to convert voice into high-dimensional vector (embedding).

Represents speaker characteristics.

✅ c. GPT Text Response
Input: Predefined or real-time text.

Processed through GPT (OpenAI or local model like Ollama/LLama).

✅ d. Text-to-Speech using Voice Cloning
Synthesizer: Converts GPT reply + embedding → Mel Spectrogram

Vocoder: Converts spectrogram → waveform (actual audio)

📊 4. Spectrogram Visualization:
Mel Spectrogram generated for each cloned reply.

🔍 5. Challenges Faced & Solved:
❌ Initial Issue: Output had a buzzy/unclear voice.

✅ Fix:

Replaced faulty synthesizer.pt model.

Cleaned input recordings.

Used zero-padding for smoother waveform end (np.pad()).

Matched audio sampling rate correctly for vocoder.

🎯 6. Outcome:
Final output is clear, audible, and sounds like the original speaker.

GPT reply is dynamically converted into natural speech in the user's voice.

All voice generations are real-time and local.

Component	Input	Output	Purpose
Encoder	Your voice (.wav)	Voice embedding (vector)	Learns and represents your voice style
Synthesizer	Embedding + Text	Mel spectrogram	Plans how the AI should speak like you
Vocoder	Mel spectrogram	Audio waveform (.wav)	Produces the final audio using your voice
